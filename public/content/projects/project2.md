# Model Tokenizer

Storing data sets on decentralized file store and tokenizing them has good value. Creating this new asset class can incentivize the development of high-quality models and datasets and create new revenue streams for the creators and data labelers. The general idea is to not token gate these datasets and ai models but create a more open and accessible platform for the people, broader communities to make them readily available. The platform proposed in this project aims to be the platform for tokenizing AI models and datasets, enabling open access, collaboration and creating a trusted ecosystem of labeled and verified models and datasets. Leveraging the benefits of blockchain and the decentralization ethos, this project aims to aid the creators economy, making AI models and datasets more accessible, transparent and valuable for everyone.

Following are some of the key characteristics that we aim to benift by building on ethereum ecosystem

1. Ownership/ Provinance: By tokenizing an AI model, it can be associated with a unique, non-fungible token (NFT) that can be transferred and tracked on a blockchain. This makes it possible to track ownership and provenance of the model, which can be important for intellectual property rights and accountability.
2. Access control: NFTs can be used to control access to the AI model by restricting access only to those who hold the token. This can help protect the model from unauthorized use or distribution.
3. Fractional ownership: ERC1155 tokens can represent fractional ownership of an asset, which can allow multiple parties to own a share of the AI model. This can enable new business models, such as shared ownership of AI models by research institutions or consortiums.
4. Interoperability: ERC721 and ERC1155 are both widely adopted standards for NFTs on Ethereum, which means that tokenized AI models can be easily integrated into other blockchain-based applications or platforms. This can help to create a more interconnected ecosystem of AI models and applications.
5. Value creation: Tokenizing an AI model can create a new asset class that can be bought, sold, and traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. This can potentially create new revenue streams for AI model creators and incentivize the development of high-quality models.
