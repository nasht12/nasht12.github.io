# Datanomy

Datanomy is a platform enabling individuals to post bounties, incentivizing the creation of valuable datasets and rewarding contributors with tokens. It is build upon the principles of decentralization, leveraging the capabilities of Filecoin, to ensure the security and immutability of the datasets, establishing trust and integrity in the data economy.

Users can post bounties to facilitate creation of datasets that they think would be of value. Bounty completions are incentivized with token rewards. Collected datasets are then stored on ipfs and are tokenized using erc721 contract deployed on calibaration, an evm compatible filecoin testnet. 

Through this platform, we envision a future where data contributors are fairly rewarded, data consumers have access to trustworthy datasets, and the potential of data-driven technologies is fully realized.

**What have I built**

- Post bounties to incentivize dataset creation.
- Fair rewards for contributors in tokens
- Access to trustworthy and valuable datasets
- Collabarative platform for data creation

**How it's made.**

- Next.js react framework.
- Openzepplin library (ERC721/1155)
- IPFS/ Filecoin (Lighthouse, web3storage, fevm)
- remix/ hardhat
- MUI frontend
- Vercel

**Future work.**

1. Deploy on filecoin mainnet.
2. Refine the workflows, incentive and token mechanisms.
3. Extend functionality to Models. (Compute over data ***Backhaus***)
