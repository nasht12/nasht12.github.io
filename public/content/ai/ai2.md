# Inferencing Blockchains

Inference API allows developers to access and utilize the inferencing capabilities of a machine learning model. These APIs provide a simple interface for developers to send data to the model and receive the inferencing results. The applications could range from natural language processing, image and video recognition, and predictive analytics.

Inference APIs can be hosted on-premises or in the cloud. Cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft offer fully managed inference API services which abstract away the complexity of deploying and scaling machine learning models. These services can be accessed through simple API calls, be it REST, gRPC, GraphQL and they handle the underlying infrastructure, scaling, and security.

With Blockchains we have a distributed ledger that records and verify transactions in a decentralized and secure manner. We can feed these structured blockchain data into some of the available machine learning models like XGBoost, TabNet or TAPAS and can create inference apiâ€™s for different business use cases. These machine learning algorithms can be applied to the data stored on a blockchain to infer new insights and patterns.

Some of the areas we can use these inference api in the context of blockchains could be:

- **Querying**: We can query blockchain data with text without needing to write queries. Extracting on-chain data and other usage metrics would become very intuitive and simpler.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Algorithms can be applied to the data stored on a blockchain to predict future trends and patterns, which can be used to make informed decisions.
- **Identity Verification**: Analyze the identity of the signatories or the level of authorization required for a particular action
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detect and flag any abnormal behavior in a blockchain network. It is possible to identify any suspicious activities or potential security breaches
