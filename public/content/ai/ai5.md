**Search is the new cool kid on block, Again!!**

In recent weeks, the search engine industry has become increasingly competitive as companies look for new and innovative ways to stay ahead of the curve. With the integration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model into Bing, Microsoft has given itself the chance to shake up the search engine space. The ChatGPT-like experience now available on Bing will allow users to ask more up-to-date queries and have a more conversational experience. This move by Microsoft, combined with their recent investment in OpenAI, is a clear sign that the company is looking to make a significant impact in the search engine market and take on the dominant player, Google.

Google is not sitting idly by. With the announcement of their AI experiment, Bard, the company is looking to stay ahead of the curve. The experiment combines the world's knowledge with their language models and offers a lightweight version of the ChatGPT model for testing purposes. The goal for Google is to provide a conversational AI experience that can help users with various tasks and provide insights into complex information.

The early days of search engines were a wild west of sorts. First, there was Archie, a scrappy little engine that scoured FTP sites for any tidbits of information it could find. Then came WebCrawler, a fearless pioneer venturing into the uncharted frontier of the World Wide Web. And let's not forget the Yahoo Directory, a veritable curatorial mastermind, meticulously compiling a list of websites with the human touch.

As the 90s gave way to the new millennium, two powerhouses emerged: AltaVista and Lycos. AltaVista was a trailblazer, using link popularity as the yardstick for relevance and importance. Lycos, on the other hand, was a pioneer in the realm of crawling, indexing web pages with breakneck speed.

And then there was Google, a behemoth of the search world. With its PageRank algorithm, Google had the power to determine the relevance of web pages based on links. Its sleek and intuitive interface soon had the masses flocking to it, leaving its competitors in the rearview mirror.

As we see companies like Microsoft and Google look to innovate in the search engine space, it is clear that the dominance of Google in the search engine industry cannot be taken for granted. The focus on conversational AI and the integration of cutting-edge technology is a testament to how search engines are becoming fashionable again and how companies are looking to stay ahead of the curve.

The future of search engines looks promising, and it will be exciting to see how these companies continue to innovate and push the boundaries of what is possible. Whether it is through conversational AI or new ways of presenting information, the search engine industry is set to continue evolving and changing the way we interact with the web.
