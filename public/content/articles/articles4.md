**Solidity Design Patterns**

Design patterns are a way of organizing and structuring code to improve its efficiency, security, and maintainability. Lets look at some of the common design patterns in solidity

**Guard check pattern**

The guard pattern is used to ensure that certain conditions are met before a contract function is executed. For example, a guard may be used to ensure that only authorized users can access certain contract functions, or that a contract function can only be called at a certain time.

- require() - refunding all of the gas that has not been consumed at the time the exception is thrown `0xfd`(`REVERT`)
- revert() - refunding all of the gas that has not been consumed at the time the exception is thrown `0xfd`(`REVERT`)
- assert() - Uses all the gas included in the transaction `0xfe`(`INVALID`)

underlying opcode for require and assert changed after byzantine update.

- Example

  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  contract GuardExample {
  address public owner;
  uint public balance;
  constructor() {
      owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function withdraw(uint amount) public {
      require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");
      require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient funds");
      balance -= amount;
      payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
  }
  }
  ```

  In this example, the **`withdraw()`** function allows the owner of the contract to withdraw a specified amount of funds. However, before the function can be executed, two guard checks are performed to ensure that only the owner can access the funds and that there are sufficient funds available for withdrawal.
  The first guard check uses the **`require()`** function to check whether the address of the caller (**`msg.sender`**) is equal to the address of the contract owner. If the condition is not met, the function will throw an exception and the transaction will be reverted.
  The second guard check uses another **`require()`** function to check whether the requested withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the current contract balance. If the condition is not met, the function will throw an exception and the transaction will be reverted.
  If both guard checks are passed, the function will subtract the requested amount from the contract balance and transfer the funds to the owner's address using the **`transfer()`** function.
  By using guard checks in this way, the smart contract can ensure that only authorized users can access certain functions and that all required conditions are met before executing potentially sensitive operations such as fund transfers.

**Factory pattern**

Factory pattern is a way of creating new contracts in a modular and efficient way. In this pattern, a factory contract is used to create new instances of a child contract, rather than creating each new contract individually. This can help to reduce gas costs and simplify the code.

- Example

  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  contract Child {
      uint public value;

      constructor(uint _value) {
          value = _value;
      }
  }

  contract Factory {
      Child[] public children;

      function createChild(uint _value) public {
          Child child = new Child(_value);
          children.push(child);
      }
  }
  ```

  In this example, we have a simple **`Child`** contract that stores an integer value, and a **`Factory`** contract that creates instances of the **`Child`** contract using the **`new`** keyword.
  The **`Factory`** contract has a public function **`createChild(uint _value)`** that takes an integer value as input. This function creates a new **`Child`** contract instance using the **`new Child(_value)`** syntax, and adds it to the **`children`** array using the **`push()`** function.

**State machine pattern**

The state machine pattern is a way of organizing contract logic into different states, each of which represents a different phase in the contract's lifecycle. This can help to improve the security and maintainability of the code, as well as making it easier to understand and debug.

- Example

  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  contract StateMachine {
      enum State { Waiting, Active, Inactive }

      State public state;

      constructor() {
          state = State.Waiting;
      }

      function activate() public {
          require(state == State.Waiting, "StateMachine: Can only activate from Waiting state");
          state = State.Active;
      }

      function deactivate() public {
          require(state == State.Active, "StateMachine: Can only deactivate from Active state");
          state = State.Inactive;
      }

      function reset() public {
          state = State.Waiting;
      }
  }
  ```

  we have a simple **`StateMachine`** contract that uses an enumeration to represent different states. The **`state`** variable is set to the **`Waiting`** state when the contract is deployed.
  The **`activate()`** and **`deactivate()`** functions are used to change the state of the contract. Both functions use the **`require()`** function to check that the current state of the contract is correct before updating the state variable. If the condition is not met, an exception will be thrown.
  The **`reset()`** function is used to reset the contract to its initial **`Waiting`** state.

**Circuit breaker pattern**

The circuit breaker pattern is used to allow a contract owner to temporarily disable certain contract functions in case of a security issue or other problem. This can help to prevent malicious actors from exploiting vulnerabilities in the code.

- Example

  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  contract CircuitBreaker {
      bool public stopped = false;
      address public owner;

      constructor() {
          owner = msg.sender;
      }

      modifier onlyOwner() {
          require(msg.sender == owner, "CircuitBreaker: Only contract owner can call this function");
          _;
      }

      function stop() public onlyOwner {
          stopped = true;
      }

      function start() public onlyOwner {
          stopped = false;
      }

      function withdraw(uint amount) public {
          require(!stopped, "CircuitBreaker: Contract is currently stopped");
          // ... withdraw funds ...
      }
  }
  ```

  **`CircuitBreaker`** contract allows the contract owner to stop and start the contract using the **`stop()`** and **`start()`** functions.
  The **`withdraw()`** function is used to withdraw funds from the contract, but it includes a **`require()`** statement that checks whether the **`stopped`** variable is set to **`false`**. If the variable is set to **`true`**, indicating that the contract is stopped, the function will throw an exception and prevent the funds from being withdrawn.

**Proxy pattern**

The proxy pattern is used to create a contract that acts as an interface for other contracts on the network. This can help to simplify the interactions between contracts and improve the efficiency of the code. Additionally, it allows for easier upgrading of the underlying implementation contract without having to change the interface or address used by external contracts.

- Example

  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  contract Implementation {
      uint public value;

      function setValue(uint _value) public {
          value = _value;
      }
  }

  contract Proxy {
      address public implementation;

      constructor(address _implementation) {
          implementation = _implementation;
      }

      fallback() external payable {
          address target = implementation;
          assembly {
              calldatacopy(0, 0, calldatasize())
              let result := delegatecall(gas(), target, 0, calldatasize(), 0, 0)
              returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())
              switch result
              case 0 { revert(0, returndatasize()) }
              default { return(0, returndatasize()) }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  we have a simple **`Implementation`** contract that stores an integer value, and a **`Proxy`** contract that acts as an interface for the **`Implementation`** contract.
  The **`Proxy`** contract has a **`implementation`** variable that holds the address of the **`Implementation`** contract. It also has a fallback function that delegates all calls to the **`Implementation`** contract using the **`delegatecall()`** function.
  When a user calls a function on the **`Proxy`** contract, the fallback function is executed and the **`calldata`** is copied to memory. The **`delegatecall()`** function is then used to execute the same function on the **`Implementation`** contract, passing along the **`calldata`** and any value attached to the call. If the call is successful, the return data is copied back to memory and returned to the user.
