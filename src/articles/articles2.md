# ERC-998

ERC-998 Composable NFTs, is a standard extension for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. The standard allows NFTs to own other NFTs or fungible tokens, creating a hierarchy of assets. This new standard allows for more creative and dynamic use cases for NFTs, such as creating actionable assets.

Let's imagine that you want to represent a house on the Ethereum blockchain using ERC-998. In this scenario, the house itself would be the main NFT (or "parent" NFT) and would have several other NFTs as its "child" assets.

The house NFT could own an NFT for the land title, an NFT for the house structure, and NFTs for each of the house's rooms. The rooms could then own NFTs for any furniture or fixtures within the room, such as a bed, a TV, or a lamp.

With this setup, transferring the house NFT would automatically transfer all of its child assets, including the land title, house structure, and all the furniture and fixtures within the house.

Let's explore a few of these use cases

**Legal Contracts**
Legal contracts are often long and difficult to understand, but with the use of ERC-998 Composables, this process can be made much easier. Legal contracts can be composed of standard clauses, which would be represented as non-fungible tokens. The overall contract would be an ERC-998 composable, which would hold information about the parties involved in the agreement.

**Supply Chain Provenance**
ERC-998 Composables can be used in supply chains. For example, tracking coffee beans from harvest to cup can be made much easier. A new ERC-998 composable can be created for each harvest, and each bag of coffee beans can be represented as an ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token. Additionally, ERC-20 fungible tokens can be placed inside the composable to track the specific bag, roast, roaster, harvest, and farmer.

**Virtual Assets**
ERC-998 Composables can also be used in virtual asset management, such as in-game items like a shield. For example, if a player finds a few gemstones and mounts them on their shield, they can easily sell the entire composition (the shield with the mounted gems) on a decentralized market. The assets can be enumerated for the sale, and only a single purchase is needed to transfer the entire composition to the new owner.
